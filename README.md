# CSE 320 Memory Allocator

## Code Reference

All source code for the memory manipulation functions are located in `src/sfmm.c`

Code present in the `src/sfmm.c` directory was created by **Kelvin Lin** for course CSE 320 at Stony Brook University. This repository exists solely for educational and illustrative purposes. Do not plagiarize or copy any content from this repository for any purpose.

Design for dynamic memory allocation was strongly based on techniques described in **Section 9.9** of the following text:
